alpha-blog rails app for rails course,
We learned how to:
Create app rails, "rails new <app name>" in my case i have rails 7, so to use rails 6.1.4.4: "rails _6.1.4.4_ new <app name>"
create a root page, in the routes pages, we set root "<ControllerName>#<Action/MethodName>"
We create the controller in terminal with "rails generate controller <ControllerName"
